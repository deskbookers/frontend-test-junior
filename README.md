# Deskbookers Junior Frontend Test

Howdy, this exercise is in a smaller degree what your daily work at Deskbookers could be. We hope you find it interesting, and looking forward hearing from you.

## Assignment

Before you start make sure to fork this project into your github account.

### Task 1:
If you open the project file `src/index.html` with your browser you'll see an empty page with a placeholder text. But in the browsers console there two errors we need to fix:

* Something about a missing file?

* A javascript function that is not implemented, see `src/js/main.js`

### Task 2:

Now that we got the errors out of the way is time to start building our website template.

(See: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deskbookers/frontend-test-junior/master/template.png](here))

You'll find all the images in `src/img`. Bootstrap and jQuery are already included in the html project, so you shouldn't need to add anything else.
Also make sure that the index.html file is a valid html document using the w3c-validator tool: https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input

#### Nice to have

This is only if you have extra time:

* Make sure it looks good on mobile.
* Make the top header 'sticky', so that when you scroll down the page it stays on top.
* Add a floating button at the bottom right of the page, that when clicked, it will smoothly scroll to the top of the page.
